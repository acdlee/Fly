yesterday:
added text boxes to the game window
they accept input and have default text
also highlight on collision

todo:
need to work on default text disapearing when clicked on..
--> just start from fly.py and trace what happens to the
    	boxes to narrow down what you need to change

we need to work on the airplane traveling to/from airports

after that we finish up with the actual hill climb
