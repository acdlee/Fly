we'll use hill climb to find the quickest route from s to g

!!!!
we can use hillclimb to make the route for us
instead of actually going in and selecting which airports to go to
when u want to go from s to g, instead, just let the alg
decide for you

---mabye validate the above with a MST alg



have a typable input box that looks like
WELCOME TO FLY
To: .....  From: ....
where the user inputs the start and end point of his travel
-->from there, we'll have the airport start at the to and obvi
	end at the from.
-> these boxes will be positioned at the bottom of the screen
   where we have extra room
->maybe add some info likes number of miles it will take
	and other stuff like that
