we'll make a airplane travel

we'll use hill climb to find the quickest route from s to g

pygame will be the GUI
we'll have motion for the plane

!!!!
we can use hillclimb to make the route for us
instead of actually going in and selecting which airports to go to
when u want to go from s to g, instead, just let the alg
decide for you

---mabye validate the above with a MST alg
