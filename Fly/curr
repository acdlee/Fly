left off after finishing the get_distance function

made distance a dictionary

start tomorrow with some testing on those classes in airports.py

(if needed:)
then start theorizing/implementing a way to differeniate between
     distance betweene connects vs general distance and
     use of both. 

after that we can go  back to work on the visual representation of
      the flights

after that we finish up with the actual hill climb
